    <h2>A delicious meal that you can have any day</h2>
    <p>This recipe was obtained from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/238234/saigon-noodle-salad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allrecipes</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dressing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup water, or more to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Salad</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package (linguine-width) rice noodles</li>
        <li>2 cups thinly sliced Napa (Chinese) cabbage</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups matchstick-cut carrots</li>
        <li>8 ounces grilled shrimp</li>
        <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
        <li>½ English cucumber, halved lengthwise and cut into thin slices</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>½ cup coarsely chopped peanuts</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir to separate the noodles and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in colander to drain as much water as possible.</li>
        <li>Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped peanuts.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>Dressing can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 5 days.</p>
    <p>You can use sambal oelek chile pepper sauce or red pepper flakes in place of Sriracha, if that better fits your tastes.</p>
    <p>Any leftover grilled meat works well in this salad: shrimp, pork, or chicken are all great options.</p>
    <p>The salad is very flexible; try adding julienned red or yellow pepper, pea pods, baby bok choy, or substitute sliced romaine lettuce for the cabbage.</p>

    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
